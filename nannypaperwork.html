You also need it to get Workers&rsquo; Compensation Insurance, which is mandatory in Massachusetts. For Massachusetts state tax forms, your federal EIN usually doubles as the state EIN.</p><p><div class="SIntrapara">How to get an EIN from the IRS:
</div><div class="SIntrapara"><ul><li><p>Apply <a href="http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&amp;-Self-Employed/Apply-for-an-Employer-Identification-Number-%28EIN%29-Online">online</a> (you get the EIN immediately).</p></li><li><p><a href="http://www.irs.gov/uac/Form-SS-4,-Application-for-Employer-Identification-Number-%28EIN%29">Fill out</a> form SS-4.</p></li></ul></div></p><h4>1.2<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Worker_s_.Compensation_.Insurance)"></a>Worker&rsquo;s Compensation Insurance</h4><p><div class="SIntrapara">From <a href="http://www.mass.gov/lwd/workers-compensation/investigations/who-needs-workers-compensation-insurance-in.html">mass.gov</a>:
</div><div class="SIntrapara"><blockquote><p>"With limited exceptions, every employer in the Commonwealth with one or more employee(s) is required by law to have a valid workers&rsquo; compensation policy at all times. This "no fault" insurance not only provides injured workers with medical care and partial wage replacement, but also protects the policyholders from potentially damaging lawsuits. Although most companies in Massachusetts purchase a traditional commercial insurance policy, there are alternative methods of coverage which include licensing as a self insurer, gaining membership in a self insurance group, or obtaining coverage in the Assigned Risk Pool."</p></blockquote></div></p><p>I signed up for the Massachusetts Worker&rsquo;s Compensation Assigned Risk Pool (MWCARP). More info available at the Massachusetts Workers&rsquo; Compensation Rating and Inspection Bureau (WCRIB) <a href="https://www.wcribma.org/mass/default.aspx">website</a> (though the site is pretty dense and I had trouble finding anything there).</p><p>Most insurance agencies should be able to help you sign up for assigned risk pool. I don&rsquo;t remember exactly but I probably googled something like "massachusetts workers compensation insurance" and then submitted a bunch of quote requests online. I arbitrarily went with <a href="http://www.berryinsurance.com">Berry Insurance</a> and the cost was $260. I think the cost is state-mandated so it probably doesn&rsquo;t matter who you get it through. Also, the MWCARP application they gave me to fill out did not seem company-specific.</p><h3>2<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.First_.Day)"></a>First Day</h3><p><div class="SIntrapara">On the first day, you may want to ask your nanny to bring the following items:

You may wish to ask for it when you hire your employee. You should ask your employee to show you his or her social security card. The employee may show the card if it is available. You may, but are not required to, photocopy the card if the employee provides it.</p><p>An employee who does not have a social security number must apply for one on Form SS-5, Application for a Social Security Card.

The employee must also present his or her employer with acceptable documents evidencing identity and employment authorization. The employer must examine the employment eligibility and identity document(s) an employee presents to determine whether the document(s) reasonably appear to be genuine and to relate to the employee and record the document information on the Form I-9. The list of acceptable documents can be found on the last page of the form. Employers must retain Form I-9 for a designated period and make it available for inspection by authorized government officers."</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Where to File:</p><p>"Do not file Form I-9 with USCIS or U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
